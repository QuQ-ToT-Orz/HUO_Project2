\title{Creates plots for univariate Hawkes processes
Supports both single-series and multi-series models.
For multi-series models, intensity is computed for each series separately.}
\usage{
show_hawkes(obj, type = c("fitted", "data", "both"), per_series = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{TMB object from Hawkes process fitting}

\item{type}{Character string: "fitted" (intensity only),
"data" (histogram only), or "both" (both plots). Default: "fitted"}

\item{per_series}{Logical, for multi-series models:
if TRUE, show faceted plots for each series;
if FALSE (default), show combined/overlaid plot.}
}
\value{
ggplot object or grid arrangement depending on type
