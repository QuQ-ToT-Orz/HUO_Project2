\title{Check valid wake days for NHANES 2011-2014 accelerometer data}
\usage{
check_valid_wake_days(act, flags, threshold_lower = 600, rm_PAXQFM = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{act}{Activity data frame with accelerometer data including SEQN, PAXDAYWM, PAXQFM
and MIN1-MIN1440 columns.}

\item{flags}{Flag data frame with wear/non-wear flags. Should have same structure as act
but with wear/sleep/non-wear status flags (1=wake wear, 2=sleep wear, 3=non-wear, 4=unknown).}

\item{threshold_lower}{Minimum number of wake wear minutes required for a valid day.
Defaults to 600 (10 hours).}

\item{rm_PAXQFM}{Logical indicating whether to exclude days with quality control flags.
Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of indices for valid days that meet the wear time and quality criteria.
}
\description{
This function checks accelerometer data for valid days based on wake wear time criteria
and data quality flags. Adapted for NHANES 2011-2014 MIMS data format.
}
\details{
This function is specifically designed for NHANES 2011-2014 MIMS data which uses different
flag coding than earlier NHANES waves. Wake wear time is calculated as minutes where
flag == 1 (wake wear).
